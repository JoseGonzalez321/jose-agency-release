# Jose Agency

A minimal copy of [Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) theme.

>[Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) is a one page agency portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals, a responsive timeline, and a working PHP contact form.

## Why?

This the **bare** minimum needed to deploy a cool site to something like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## See it live!

## Awesome! Can I have it?

Sure thing! Clone away.

## What do I need to do?

Open the `index.html` file and replace my information (contact info, images, etc). You do not need to touch any other file. 

*Note:* Some basic HTML knowledge is necessary but it's pretty straight forward.

## How do I run this?

Double-click on the `index.html` file on your file explorer. It should open on your default web browser.

That's it!
